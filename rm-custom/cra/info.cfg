addinfo "Some maps contain Buffs - kind of permanent powerups. Usually, Buffs are bound to teams and located on their respective bases. Once a Buff has been taken, it will not respawn until the player holding it dies or leaves the game. You may have only one Buff active at once and you can't grab Buffs from an enemy team's base."

addinfo "The ^4Guard^7 Buff makes your health and armor regenerate up to 150. In addition to that, it will instantly heal you up to 100 health and armor on pickup."

addinfo "The ^5Arc^7 Buff enhances your weapon with a chain lightning effect. Your hits will bounce off the target to nearby enemies recursively. However, damage is reduced by 45% with each jump and it won't hit a single target more than once. Best used against a pack of enemies, as it doesn't give you any 1on1 advantage."

addinfo "The ^2Supply^7 Buff increases your Rifle's magazine capacity up to 12, boost nadget regeneration rate by 20% and increase the value of all pickups by 50% (including mega healths and large armors!)"

addinfo "The ^3Haste^7 Buff increases your movement speed by 20% and reduce shooting and nadget cooldowns by 25%."

addinfo "The ^6Medic^7 Buff enables you to heal allies by attempting to deal damage to them and increase revival speed by 30%. However, you deal 60% less damage to enemy players while under this effect. Self-healing is half as effective."

addinfo "The ^xF80Bash^7 Buff makes your bullets explosive, able to deal splash damage and push players. Be careful at close range, you can hurt yourself."

addinfo "The ^1Vampire^7 Buff makes you leech health out of your enemies. Each time you deal damage, you gain 10% of damage done per second over 7 seconds."

addinfo "The ^xAACTenacity^7 Buff reduces all damage taken by 10% and makes you immune to all Nadget, splash, area-of-effect and self damage."

addinfo "While the Reflective Shield is active, the user is immobile and their Buff effects are temporarily disabled."

addinfo "In Jailbreak, the jail is unlocked by capturing a control point. Enemy points get assigned to your team, which gives an extra jailbreak opportunity to the enemy team later. You should attempt to take the yellow control point(s) and prevent the other team from doing so. However, be prepared to attack their base if that fails, and don't forget to defend yours!"

addinfo "Watch out for Fire Traps. They are often placed on strategically important areas such as Jailbreak/Domination control points. You can shoot the trap with the rifle, which will cause it to explode as if it was your own projectile. You will still take damage from the fire if you get too close, but your team will not."

addinfo "Plasma Bombs, Fire Traps and Napalm Grenades can be very effective at preventing mass revivals and control point captures."

addinfo "Reflective Shields return 80% damage back to the attacker, the protected target only takes the remaining 20% of that damage. You can use this to kill shielders if you suspect they are low on HP, but make sure to stay healthy yourself."

addinfo "All players inside the Linking Shell take 40% less damage and gain 10 health per second. Their health, armor and damage taken is redistributed evenly. If a Buffed player is inside, all other players temporarily get a weaker version of her Buff's effect."

addinfo "Press the Hook key (E by default) to use your Nadget. Some of them require you to hold the key down to accumulate throw force. Some of them may also be manually triggered using the Drop Weapon key (G by default)."

addinfo "Hold the Drop Flag key (F by default) to use the hook. It's a great tool to drag frozen players."

addinfo "In Freezetag, stand next to your frozen team mates to bring them back to action, and maybe they'll return the favor when you get in trouble!"

addinfo "You can use the Fire key to place ^xFB0ENEMY SEEN^7 marks for your team while frozen."

addinfo "Double-tap the movement keys to quickly dash in your movement direction. Very useful to quickly get away from danger. Combine with wall jumping for significantly faster movement around the map."

addinfo "If you hit an enemy with the Translocator, you'll instantly deal 175 damage to them, even if they are protected by a Reflective Shield."

addinfo "When you teleport with the Translocator, your rifle clip is instantly refilled."
